\section*{Abstract}

Understanding how animal movement influences disease transmission processes is critical to manage disease in wildlife and to eventually predict outbreaks or spillovers. These goals, however, require a thorough understanding of the intricate relationships between the environment, movement, and interactions among individuals, particularly processes with complex temporal dynamics.
We determined how the risk of disease transmission in wildlife varies across space and time under different epidemiological conditions (parasite persistence in the environment, transmission contact distance), different degrees of social interaction, and different conditions of data availability. For this, we derived a new framework to estimate a spatially explicit, pairwise, expected risk of disease transmission based on animal movement data (e.g. GPS tracking data). We derived general conclusions related to direct transmission analytically, tested the influence of epidemiological covariates and data availability using simulations. Finally, we applied our framework to empirical tracking data of white-tailed deer. 
We found both analytically and through simulations that temporal correlations in local space use, which arise mostly from social interactions, can significantly increase the expected force of infection (FOI), by orders of magnitude in some cases. This effect was greater for parasites with short environmental persistence (relative to host movement rate), compared to parasites with longer persistence.  
Using empirical data from white-tailed deer, we found large differences in estimated FOI between pairs, which are not explained solely by differences in home range overlap. Individuals with more correlated movement had significantly higher FOI. These differences would scale to the population level, generating vastly different dynamics of invasion and spread.
%Our results provide guidelines that relate the biology of parasites and the inferences that can be made regarding transmission using UDs. 
Our approach can be easily integrated with frameworks that estimate utilization distributions accounting for environmental covariates, which would allow to create an environmentally-informed FOI that could potentially be extrapolated to other populations and locations. Understanding the environmental and social processes that generate correlations in space use will be key moving forward to accurately estimate an expected FOI  given environmental drivers. 

\section*{Introduction}

Individual movement is among the most critical factors influencing wildlife disease dynamics \citep{Dougherty2018,Manlove2022}. 
How animals move determines whether they encounter other individuals of the same species, other species, or parasites in the environment \citep{Martinez-Garcia2020,Das2023}. 
These encounters are necessary for the transmission of infectious diseases, and efforts have sought to identify where they occur, how often, and how they are influenced by environmental drivers \citep{Titcomb2021,Dougherty2022}. 
Being able to formally link environmental factors, animal movement, contact, and parasite transmission, could improve our ability to predict and prevent outbreaks and would represent a significant advancement for management of wildlife diseases.  
Nevertheless, understanding how these processes interact at an individual scale requires detailed movement information, and analytical frameworks to translate it into an epidemiological context.

Recent approaches developed at the interface of movement and disease ecology leverage high-resolution animal tracking data to gain insight into contact among individuals and disease transmission \citep{Richardson2015,Wilber2022,Yang2023}. For example, movement-driven modeling of spatio-temporal infection risk (MoveSTIR) builds dynamic spatio-temporal contact networks from which we can estimate the risk of infection for different individuals across space and time \citep{Wilber2022}. MoveSTIR provides a theoretical foundation to translate contacts into the epidemiological currency of force of infection (the risk of transmission experienced by a host per unit time). These studies have highlighted the importance of individual heterogeneity and temporal scale for disease dynamics, particularly how indirect contact---individuals at the same place at different times---can significantly reshape contact and transmission networks \citep{Richardson2015,Yang2023}. Current approaches are nonetheless based on occurrence, rather than range, distributions \citep[in the terminology of ][]{Alston2022} -- meaning it only considers where animals were observed and not where they \emph{potentially} could have moved. This makes it difficult to systematically link observed encounters with environmental drivers, and to predict how social or environmental changes affect contact and transmission. 

Spatio-temporal contact could alternatively be studied probabilistically, using utilization distributions (UDs). The UD represents the probability---transient or long-term \citep{Tao2016}---of using a particular area \citep{Worton1989}, and is perhaps the best representation of the relationship between environment and space use over different time scales \citet{Webber2023}. The high spatial and temporal resolution of modern tracking data serves to build UDs based on biologically realistic movement models \citep{Kranstauber2012,Fleming2014}, and to link them with underlying resources \citep{Potts2023}.
Individual UDs also serve to study pairwise interactions, for example to quantify home range overlap \citep{Winner2018}, or to estimate the expected location and rate of encounter between individuals \citep{Noonan2021}, which could be used to infer transmission risk \citep{Godfrey2010, Godfrey2013,Noonan2021}. 
Moreover, because UDs can be directly linked to environmental drivers of movement \citep{Signer2017}, they could be used for prospective analyses, to predict contact and transmission in novel environments, or to understand cascading effects of environmental and social perturbations from individual movement to population and landscape-level disease transmission. 

Current contact metrics based on UDs focus only on direct interaction, ignoring temporal dynamics that are especially relevant for epidemiological processes. The Conditional Distribution of Encounters (CDE) \citep{Noonan2021}, for example, estimates local probabilities of encounter assuming that individuals move independently from each other.
While a useful simplification, social interactions like territoriality or gregariousness can invalidate this assumption \citep{Manlove2018,Sah2018}. In these cases, temporal correlations in space use could increase or decrease the expected probability of encounter compared to an assumption of independent movement \citep{Kjaer2008,Schauber2015a}. 
Moreover, direct interactions do not necessarily equate to \emph{epidemiological contacts}, which consist of contact formation, contact duration, pathogen acquisition, pathogen shedding, and pathogen decay. As some parasites can persist in the environment for months or years (e.g. anthrax, CWD), ignoring these processes could severely underestimate transmission risks  \citep{Wilber2022,Yang2023,Richardson2015}.

A large portion of epidemiological theory is built upon the assumption of independent host movements, but there is very little theory that quantifies how correlated movements affect contact and transmission risk. In contrast, there is a large body of empirical work that empirically quantifies how correlated and social movements can reshape contact and transmission landscapes \citep{Kjaer2008,Grear2010,Schauber2015a,Webber2023} [other citations from non-deer systems needed]. In general, we lack a way to quantify the role of social interactions on spatio-temporal force of infection, which limits our ability to assess when correlated movements could influence infection risk significantly. One of our goals in this study is to determine how correlated movements affect spatio-temporal infection risk for directly and indirectly transmitted pathogens. %Bridging this gap between empirical observations and theoretical expectations is a key missing link. 
The previously developed MoveSTIR implicitly accounts for such correlations, but only applies for observed data. In contrast, the CDE provides a basis for estimating encounter probabilities across the landscape, but ignores correlations and temporal dynamics of indirect contact.
Ultimately, an approach is needed that combines the range-distribution inference of UDs and CDEs \citep{Alston2022,Noonan2021} with the epidemiological focus of MoveSTIR to link UDs to epidemiological dynamics. 

Here, we develop a model we refer to as Probabilistic MoveSTIR (PMoveSTIR) to estimate epidemiological contact and expected force of infection across space and time from UDs. Our approach provides probabilistic, spatio-temporal contact networks that can be used to predict out-of-sample transmission risk. We derive a general model for transient, spatially heterogeneous UDs, and provide modifications to consider stationarity in space or time. %We show how PMoveSTIR encompasses other common assumptions such as mass action transmission and home range overlap transmission as special cases. 
Deriving analytical results and applying PMoveSTIR to simulated data, we demonstrate the sometimes sizable importance of non-independent movements on pairwise transmission risk, indicating that ignoring social drivers of contact could severely bias epidemiological inference. We show that this result primarily holds for parasites with short environmental persistence (relative to host movement rate). %For parasites that persist for long periods of time in the environment, non-independent host movements are largely inconsequential compared to spatial overlap for transmission risk. 
Using a dataset of white-tail deer movements, we show that correlated movements can increase potential force of infection by orders of magnitude for a hypothetical directly transmitted parasite but are relatively unimportant for a hypothetical parasite with long persistence times. 
Overall, PMoveSTIR is a critical next step for developing predictive models that link movement data to spatio-temporal infection dynamics on real landscapes.

\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Model development - Linking utilization distributions to transmission through PMoveSTIR}

PMoveSTIR builds on the MoveSTIR model \citep{Wilber2022} and formally links utilization distributions, direct and indirect contacts, correlated animal movements, and spatial estimates of force of infection (FOI). This is an essential metric that underlies our ability to predict the spread of disease across populations and landscapes. Essentially, we want to know, for two individuals $i$ and $j$ moving and interacting across a landscape, what is the FOI $i$ experiences from $j$, across space and time?  

As in MoveSTIR, we assume that transmission happens by an infected host depositing pathogen into the environment and another host picking that pathogen up. 
Deposition and acquisition can represent a range of processes, from one individual coughing and another inhaling in a matter of seconds, to one host depositing parasite eggs or larvae in the environment and another individual consuming these days or weeks later. 
This fairly general assumption encompasses standard density-dependent transmission as a special case \citep{Cortez2021}. 
Moreover, considering transmission through deposition and acquisition clearly links direct and indirect transmission along a continuum \citep{Wilber2022}.

In PMoveSTIR, we assume ``contacts'' occur if both individuals visit a given location $x$, which could be a habitat patch or a grid cell. 
We assume that locations $x$ do not overlap so the sum of their areas equals some total area over which individuals can move (see Appendix 1 for a derivation when $x$ is a point, not an area). 
Furthermore, we assume that the likelihood of contact is uniform within the location $x$, consistent with a so-called top-hat encounter function \citep{Gurarie2013,Wilber2022}.

Given these assumptions, we define the pairwise FOI host $j$ exerts on host $i$ in location $x$ at time $t$ as \citep{Wilber2022}
\begin{equation}
    h_{i \leftarrow j}(t, x) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} \beta' \lambda \delta_{x_j(u)}(x) \delta_{I_j(u)}(I) S(t - u) du
    \label{eq:original_foi}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the pathogen deposition rate, $\delta_{x_j(u)}(x)$ is an indicator variable that is one if host $j$ is in location $x$ at time $u$ and zero otherwise, $\delta_{I_j(u)}(I)$ is an indicator function that is one if host $j$ is in an infected state at time $u$ and zero otherwise, and $S(t-u)$ is the probability that any pathogen deposited at time $u < t$ is still alive at time $t$ \citep[see][for a full derivation]{Wilber2022}. 
The term $\beta'$ is the rate at which host $i$ picks up pathogen within location $x$ and can be re-written as $\tilde{\beta} / A_x$, where $\tilde{\beta}$ can be considered a ``search efficiency'' term, with units area/time (e.g., $m^2 / day$), and $A_x$ gives the area of location $x$ (e.g., 100 $m^2$). 
Therefore, the total acquisition rate scales with the area in which contact can occur; in larger areas, the acquiring host would have to search for longer to find a ``packet'' of pathogen, reducing the total acquisition rate and the corresponding FOI. Moving forward, we assume that host the depositing host is always infected. This is equivalent to building a contact network and also represents the structural form of FOI needed to compute pathogen invasion thresholds \citep{Wilber2022}.

Considering probabilistic space use (i.e., we know where an individual is at a given time and location with some probability), we can re-write equation \ref{eq:original_foi} as
\begin{equation}
    h_{i \leftarrow j}(t, x) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} \beta' \lambda \delta'_{x_i(t)}(x) \delta'_{x_j(u)}(x) S(t - u) du
    \label{eq:prob_foi}
\end{equation}
where $\delta'_{x_i(t)}(x)$ and $\delta'_{x_j(u)}(x)$ are random variables that specify whether or not (i.e., 0 or 1) host $i$ or host $j$ is in location $x$ at time $t$.  This means that $h_{i \leftarrow j}(t, x)$ is also a random variable, and we can express its expected value as 
\begin{equation}
    E[h_{i \leftarrow j}(t, x)] := h^*_{i \leftarrow j}(t, x) = \int_{-\infty}^{t} \beta' \lambda E[\delta'_{x_i(t)}(x) \delta'_{x_j(u)}(x)] S(t - u) du.
    \label{eq:expected_foi}
\end{equation}
Interpreting this expectation, we are asking: if we simulated some movement process thousands of times, what is the probability that host $i$ is in location $x$ at time $t$, and host $j$ was in location $x$ at a previous time $u$? 

\subsubsection*{Linking equation \ref{eq:expected_foi} to utilization distributions}

For two random variables $Y$ and $Z$, $E[YZ] = E[Y]E[Z] + Cov(Y, Z)$.  We can therefore write equation \ref{eq:expected_foi} as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        h^*_{i \leftarrow j}(t, x) &= \int_{-\infty}^{t} \frac{\tilde{\beta}}{A_x} \lambda E[\delta'_{x_i(t)}(x) \delta'_{x_j(u)}(x)] S(t - u) du \\
        &= \frac{\tilde{\beta}}{A_x} \lambda \int_{-\infty}^{t} [E[\delta'_{x_i(t)}(x)] E[\delta'_{x_j(u)}(x)] + Cov(\delta'_{x_i(t)}(x), \delta'_{x_j(u)}(x))] S(t - u) du \\
        &= \frac{\tilde{\beta}}{A_x} \lambda \int_{-\infty}^{t} [p_i(x, t) p_j(x, u) + Cov(\delta'_{x_i(t)}(x), \delta'_{x_j(u)}(x))] S(t - u) du \\
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:foi_cov}
\end{equation}
where we use the fact that the expectation of an indicator variable is a probability \citep{Grimmett2001}. The terms $p_i(x, t)$ and $p_j(x,u)$ give the probabilities that host $i$ and $j$ are in location $x$ at times $t$ and $u$, respectively, and can also be written as $p_i(x, t) = \int_{A_x} f_i(s, t) ds$ where $f_i(s, t)$ is the probability density of host $i$ using the point $s$ at time $t$ and the integral is over the area $A_x$ (defined equivalently for host $j$). Thus, we have obtained an equation that links the transient utilization distributions $f_i(s, t)$ and $f_j(s, u)$ with the spatio-temporal FOI.
This general PMoveSTIR formulation accounts for heterogeneity in space and time, but the model can consider other scenarios, for example when space use is uniform, or when UDs are stationary in time  (Fig. \ref{fig:square}, Appendix \colorbox{orange}{XXX}). 
%In the upper-left corner, we consider space use is uniform, but movement is non-stationary. In this case, it is not important where an individual is, just when. Considering this framing from an empirical point of view, proximity loggers deployed on individual hosts---a commonly used tool to measure among-animal contacts \citep{Drewe2012}---only tell us when contacts between individuals occur, but not where.  Thus, we cannot make inference about spatial factors driving contacts, but can make inference on temporal processes.  We consider this case in a future study.

\subsection*{Analytical and simulation insight into correlated movement and FOI}

Leveraging PMoveSTIR, we used analytical analysis, simulation, and empirical data to ask: how much can correlated movements affect spatio-temporal infection risk for directly and indirectly transmitted parasites? 
First, we used PMoveSTIR to derive a general formula that explicitly quantifies how much correlation can augment or reduce force of infection due to direct contact compared to random movement. We also derived analytical results for a specific movement pattern to demonstrate how correlated movements alter transmission risk due to indirect transmission.
Second, we used simulations to explore how temporally correlated movements affect  transmission, and how the pairwise FOI estimate depends on epidemiological parameters such as contact distance and parasite survival. In eq.\ref{eq:foi_stationary}, the correlation component is entirely dependent on the observed trajectories and is therefore susceptible to the amount of data available. We explored the implications of this by simulating different tracking times. We focus on the lower-right corner of the PMoveSTIR box (eq. \ref{eq:stationary_cor}), where we assume statistical stationarity in movement. The process for calculating the FOI across the landscape is summarized in Fig. \ref{fig:steps}.

In every simulation, we have two individuals moving around established home ranges, according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To create different levels of correlation, we modify the initial simulated tracks using a convolution approach with a social interaction kernel \citep{Scharf2018}. This method accounts for constant or temporally varying attraction between pairs of individuals. For our purposes we assume attraction strength is constant in time, but varies across pairs from 0 (completely independent movement) to 1 (joint movement). Strong interactions lead to similar and highly overlapping trajectories, which could represent animals in a herd, courting/mating pairs, or parents with their offspring.
For every scenario, we fit continuous-time movement models to the simulated tracks, and estimate individual UDs using autocorrelated kernel density estimation \citep{Calabrese2016}. We estimate the UDs on a grid of square cells, where the cell side $d$ is the threshold contact distance for epidemiological contact. 

We use the UDs to calculate the product of the probabilities of use ($p_i(x)p_j(x)$) and the product of their standard deviations ($\sqrt{p_i(x)(1-p_i(x))}\sqrt{p_j(x)(1-p_j(x))}$) for each grid cell. Both products are symmetrical for every pair of individuals. 
The lagged correlation term is calculated based on the position history for each individual at locations that both visited (locations that only one or neither individual visited have a correlation of zero). This is a binary vector that specifies whether each individual was present (1) or absent (0) at location $x$ at time $t$. 
The order of visits matters, so these correlation values can be asymmetric between individuals. 
Correlations can appear spuriously even in the absence of a true interaction, particularly for time series, which are often autocorrelated. To address this issue, we performed a prewhitening step to remove the potential effects of autocorrelation on the estimated cross-correlation. This procedure consists of fitting an autoregression model to one of the series, and filtering both of them using the coefficients estimated from the model \citep{Dean2016}. Additionally, we retained only correlation values that were significantly different from 0, i.e. correlations with absolute values greater than a threshold of $1.96/\sqrt(N)$, where $N$ is the length of each time series \citep{Dean2016}. All other values were set to 0 as they are considered random noise.
We then scale each correlation value by $e^{-\nu s}$ due to the decay of the parasite, where $s$ is the lag corresponding to each cross-correlation, between 0 and $t-dt$, and $dt$ is the (constant) time lag between observations. 

Substituting the terms in equation \ref{eq:stationary_cor} and scaling by the epidemiological parameters $\tilde\beta\lambda/ A_x$ we obtain the per-cell FOI. Negative correlation terms could occasionally make a cell's estimated FOI negative, especially for small cells where the probabilities of use are low; the FOI is nevertheless strictly positive by definition, so in these cases we set the cell FOI to zero.
Through these simulations we explore how the expected FOI is influenced by correlation in space use, home range overlap, parasite decay rate, and contact distance. %We also explore how the contribution from the correlation to the total and local FOI varies. 

\subsection*{Empirical application - White-tailed deer}

To test the role of space-use and correlated movements on potential transmission risk in a real system, we applied the PMoveSTIR model to GPS-tracking data for five white-tailed deer (\emph{Odocoileus virginianus}) from Ames Plantation, Tennessee, USA (two bucks and three does). 
Deer were captured and equipped with GPS collars that recorded fixes every 30 minutes (Lotek LifeTrack IR 420; IACUC \# 2850-1021 from the University of Tennessee).  All individuals used in this study were captured at the end of March 2023 but we only included movement data from May to June in this study (removing April data to eliminate any capture effects on movement).  We fit continuous-time movement models to each track and estimated the utilization distributions (UD) using AKDEs \citep{Calabrese2016}. Using the fitted continuous-time movement model for each individual, we interpolated the positions to regular 10 minute intervals to account for missed fixes \citep{Yang2023}.  We defined a contact as occurring when hosts occupied the same 10m by 10m square cell.  

We modeled two hypothetical pathogens. The first pathogen had a relatively short persistence time in the environment, surviving for an average of 1 hour  ($\nu=1 h^{-1}$). In this case, transmission is largely direct and this might represent a pathogen like SARS-COV-2, which can infect and transmit between white-tailed deer \citep{Hale2022}. The second hypothetical pathogen had a long persistence time, remaining viable for over a year on average ($\nu=0.9 yr^{-1}$). In this case, transmission is largely indirect and might reflect a pathogen like chronic wasting disease (CWD), which can transmit directly and indirectly between deer and can persist for years in the environment \citep{Saunders2012a}. The $\beta$ and $\lambda$ parameters are scalars in PMoveSTIR and do not affect any relative comparisons, so we set them both to unity. As in the simulations, we prewhitened and filtered correlation values to remove potentially spurious correlations. 
We use these data to explore how differences in overlap across home ranges and correlated movement influence the expected FOI with real animal trajectories.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{The importance of correlated movements on FOI -- analytical results}

To gain analytical intuition into the role that correlated movement can have on FOI, consider equation \ref{eq:uniform_stationary1} where movement is statistically stationary and hosts use space uniformly.  %As we showed above, when correlation in movement is zero, equation \ref{eq:uniform_stationary1} reduces to mass action transmission. 
For illustrative purposes, consider two hosts moving together across some area $A_{tot}$. We assume that 1) hosts spend $\eta$ time units within a habitat patch/grid cell before moving to the next one, 2) the pathogen survival function $S(s)$ is a step function with a survival probability of one when lag $s \leq \pi \eta$ and zero when $s > \pi \eta$.  
The term $\pi \eta$ gives the time the pathogen survives in the environment as a function of host residence time, where $\pi$ ranges from near zero for directly transmitted pathogens to some arbitrarily large number for pathogens with long environmental persistence.  
In this scenario, transmission can only occur while both animals are in the same patch. With these assumptions, we can rewrite equation \ref{eq:uniform_stationary1} as 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        h^*_{i \leftarrow j}(A_x) = \beta' \lambda \left[\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}} \pi \eta + \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}(1 - \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}) \int_{0}^{\pi \eta} Cor(\delta_{i \in A_x}, \delta_{j \in A_x} | s) ds\right],
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:uniform_stationary2}
\end{equation}
recognizing that $\sigma_i(x) \sigma_j(x) = \sqrt{\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}(1 - \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}})}\sqrt{\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}(1 - \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}})} = \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}(1 - \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}})$ when both hosts are using space uniformly.

\subsubsection*{Direct transmission}

For hosts that are moving together, $Cor(\delta_{i \in A_x}, \delta_{j \in A_x} | s)$ will be exactly unity when lag $s = 0$ and near unity when lag $s$ is near zero. When pathogens are strictly directly transmitted, $\pi$ is also small and if $\pi \eta << \eta$ then we can reasonably approximate $Cor(\delta_{i \in A_x}, \delta_{j \in A_x} | s) = 1$ for s from 0 to $\pi \eta$.  We can then write equation \ref{eq:uniform_stationary2} as 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        h^*_{i \leftarrow j}(A_x) = \beta' \lambda \pi \eta \left[\underbrace{\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}}_{\substack{\text{Contribution due} \\  \text{to habitat overlap}}} + \underbrace{\frac{A_x}{A_{tot}}(1 - \frac{A_x}{A_{tot}})}_{\substack{\text{Contribution due} \\ \text{to correlated movement}}} \right].
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:uniform_direct}
\end{equation}
The relative contribution of correlation in movement with respect to the contribution due to habitat overlap is simply $(1 - (A_x / A_{tot})) / (A_x / A_{tot})=A_{tot}/A_x-1$. 
Thus, PMoveSTIR allows us to put intuitive bounds on the importance of correlated movements for direct transmission risk. 
As the area $A_x$ in which an epidemiological contact can occur gets smaller relative to the total area in which the hosts are moving $A_{tot}$, correlated movement can have an orders of magnitude larger contribution to direct transmission FOI than habitat overlap (Fig. \ref{fig:analytical_corr}). Large correlations across multiple areas add up into a significantly greater FOI across the entire landscape. 
This makes intuitive sense. If the area of potential contact is small and hosts are moving randomly, there is a very low chance that hosts will be there together at the same time. Highly correlated movements significantly increase this chance, even with low correlation (e.g. 0.1). The contribution of correlation to FOI can be 10 times greater than spatial overlap if the area of contact is small (e.g., $<$ 5\% of the total area; Fig. \ref{fig:analytical_corr}).

In contrast, when $A_x$ approaches $A_{tot}$ (or more generally when the probability of using a particular area is very high), the importance of correlated movement relative to habitat overlap becomes minimal (Fig. \ref{fig:analytical_corr}). For example, if two hosts use a particular area together because of high resource availability, then it does not matter for FOI if social factors are leading to additional correlated movement. This result extends beyond epidemiological contexts and shows when correlated movements can significantly alter contact risk based on metrics such as home range overlap or CDE.

\subsubsection*{Indirect transmission}

The relative contribution of correlated movement on FOI becomes analytically more difficult to generalize for pathogens with indirect transmission. This is because the correlation function $Cor(\delta_{i \in A_x}, \delta_{j \in A_x} | s)$ can be highly non-trivial even in the simple case when two hosts are moving together. For example, even individuals that never encounter each other directly can have positive correlations at relatively short lags, and these can be greater than the correlations for individuals that do come into direct contact but only overlap partially at the same locations (Fig. S1b,c). Determining the analytical form of $Cor(\delta_{i \in A_x}, \delta_{j \in A_x} | s)$ for common movement models is beyond the scope of this study, but we show an example with a relatively simple movement scenario in Appendix S3. The example illustrates three important points: 1) the contributions of correlated movement to indirect transmission risk depend strongly on movement dynamics as reflected in $Cor(\delta_{i \in A_x}, \delta_{j \in A_x} | s)$; 2) this contribution could potentially increase, decrease, or have no effect on local FOI depending on the lag considered; 3) the relative importance of correlations at different lags is determined by the parasite survival function.

\subsection*{Simulation study}

%The overall FOI varied more than four orders of magnitude among simulations, in response to both movement and epidemiological parameters. 
\subsubsection*{Effect of correlated movement on pairwise FOI}

Greater interaction strengths led to higher overlap among home ranges, but there were also pairs moving independently with similarly high  ($>$0.9) overlap. %Simulations with interaction strengths greater than 0.9 all resulted in overlap values greater than 0.99, meaning the utilization distributions were always virtually identical. 
%Pairs moving independently had lower overlap values on average but also higher variance, so some pairs had similarly high overlap ($>$0.9). 
This allows us to compare the FOI while teasing apart the effects of spatial overlap and temporal correlation in space use. 

The FOI was higher for pairs with higher interaction values (i.e. with stronger attraction), in part due to the resulting increase in spatial overlap. %This increase was due in part to higher spatial overlap, as can be seen from the higher FOI values calculated using only the stationary UD component . 
However, we saw an even greater increase in FOI when we accounted for temporal correlation, and the difference between the two increased with higher interaction strengths (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}a). %For very similar trajectories (interaction$>$0.9), the FOI with correlation was more than ten times the FOI estimated without correlation, and there was a more than 100-fold difference for perfectly overlapping trajectories. 
Methods that ignore temporal correlation could therefore be significantly underestimating transmission risk. 

The FOI was generally greater when we accounted for correlation; in only 19\% of cases the estimates were equal with or without correlation, and in no instance was there a decrease. This is to be expected as we only included attraction in the simulations. 
We found that correlation could increase the estimated FOI even for pairs that moved independently. While this was generally rare (86\% of cases had less than 20\% increase), % In 75\% of these simulations there was virtually no difference in FOI estimates with and without correlation, and 86\% saw less than 20\% increase. 
there were  instances where the estimated FOI was more than three times greater. This was more likely for pairs with a high degree of home range overlap (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}d). 
%For pairs with low overlap, on the other hand, correlation usually did not play a significant role. % Mark here:  Here is what I struggle with for this result.  If the "truth" is no correlation (which we simulated), how do we get correlation?  To me this seems like it must be Type I error.  We are testing thousands of points for correlation and, by chance alone, we are going to **statistically** pick up correlation even if none actually exists.  One way to deal with this would be to use a bonferonni correction and set all correlation values that aren't "significant" after the Bonferronni correction to 0.  This removes a lot of those spurious correlations. 
% JUAN: Yes, most correlation values are just noise. We can remove them just by using a standard threshold that depends on the length of the series. There is still an issue that I think is due to the number of visits per cell. When there are few visits by one of the individuals (<~5), that's when you get the highest correlation values (relative to the cell's expected encounter rate). These values are high enough to be considered significant. For the same pair, with more points you get lower cumulative correlations. I tested this with the empirical data, but haven't tried to include it in the simulations.  	
While the expected correlation is 0 when individuals move independently, joint space use could lead to apparent correlations, especially when there are few observations in a given cell. This is important to keep in mind when analyzing empirical data where the true correlation nor the degree of attraction/avoidance among individuals is known. 

\subsubsection*{Influence of epidemiological parameters}

%We also analyzed how changes in epidemiological parameters, namely the parasite decay rate and the contact distance, influenced the estimated risk of transmission. 
The FOI was inversely proportional to decay rate, meaning the risk of transmission is greater for parasites that can survive longer in the environment (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}b). %This effect is driven mostly by the linear increase in the spatial overlap component ($p_i(x)p_j(x)/\nu$), for longer decay times the relative contribution of the correlation term decreased significantly (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}e). 
However, the increase in FOI due to correlated movement is greatest for parasites with short survival times. While longer parasite survival times increase the probability of indirect epidemiological contact, the expected rate of encounter at longer lags approximates the expected rate of encounter under independent movement, so correlations at long lags have only a small modifying effect on the expected FOI (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}e). 

While FOI generally increased as decay rate decreased, longer contact distances could increase or decrease FOI, depending on interaction strength. %For pairs with low interaction strength there was no noticeable effect of increasing the threshold contact distance 
(Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}c). %However, for similar trajectories (interaction $>$ 0.9), FOI increased between two and five-fold as contact distance increased, while for identical trajectories (interaction = 1) FOI decreased. 
%In our simulations, longer threshold distances translate to larger grid cells, where the risk gets diluted. 
These changes in overall FOI responds to the effect of correlation. Increasing the contact distance increases the probability of finding two individuals in the same cell, and would therefore increase the relative contribution of correlation most for trajectories that are already close in space and time (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}f), while it would have no effect for trajectories that are far from each other. For identical trajectories, however, grouping observations into larger cells imply fewer cells where correlation is impacting the FOI, and can thus reduce the cumulative contribution of correlation and overall FOI. 


\subsubsection*{Influence of data availability}
%The length of the data series had a significant influence on estimated FOI. 
With longer time series, the number of cells that both animals visited, and for which correlation is calculated, increased linearly. As a result, we estimated greater overall FOIs (although the local correlation values could decrease) when there was more tracking data (Fig. \ref{fig:simresults}e). 
%However, the proportion of those cells where the FOI estimates were different with and without the correlation component actually decreased. This could be interpreted as a decrease in the estimated correlations as more visits are made to the same cells. 
%While the proportion of cells that effectively modify the FOI decreases, the absolute number of these cells is still greater, and the overall effect is an increased FOI when there are longer time series. 
Since we did not include any environmental drivers of movement, the expected correlation is uniform across the landscape. The cumulative correlation, however, is not related to the product of the UDs or the product of the standard deviations. 
%Getting more data means that the correlations at the local (cell) level become more accurate, and that the correlation can be estimated for more locations. %Empirical movement studies should therefore try to ensure that the tracking duration is sufficient for the animals to cover the majority of their home range, so that estimated correlations are representative of the true underlying relationship. Given the complexity of the correlation, which may be determined through a combination of environmental factors and specific social interactions, predicting the underlying correlation surface could prove quite challenging. 


\subsection*{Empirical example: white-tailed deer}

The total potential FOI varied more than six orders of magnitude across pairs of deer, partially due to the difference in spatial overlap, which ranged between 0 and 90\% (Bhattacharyya coefficient). While higher overlap generally correlated with higher FOIs, we estimated significantly higher values when we accounted for correlation in movement, and the difference was not necessarily related with greater overlap (Fig. \ref{fig:empiricalres}). %For the pair with the highest spatial overlap, the FOI was more than ten times greater when we accounted for correlation. For other pairs the effect was less extreme but still considerable; 
We estimate that ignoring correlation could result in between 5\% and 96\% underestimation of FOI. 
We also noted differences in FOI within each pair, due to the order of visits to the same cells. Difference were usually small (<5\%) but in one case one estimate was 45\% higher than the other.
We only saw strong effects of correlation when we considered the parasite with a faster decay rate. For a parasite like CWD that can persist for very long in the environment, the FOI was virtually identical with or without the correlation term (Fig. \ref{fig:empiricalres}XX). 

Given the localized nature of interactions, the changes in overall FOI are caused by increases at particular cells. Consequently, the estimated FOI is heterogeneous across the landscape (Fig.\ref{fig:empiricalres}b). These effects at the local and individual scale will affect population-wide inferences about parasite transmission. For example, the $R_0$ for our individuals was more than ten times greater when we accounted for correlation (Fig. \ref{fig:empiricalres}d). We would expect faster transmission through the network than under an assumption of independent movement.



\section*{Discussion}

% General summary
We have developed a new approach for inferring epidemiological dynamics from spatially and temporally explicit data. Our work generalizes the MoveSTIR framework \citep{Wilber2022}, which translated observed movement and encounter data to the currency of force of infection (FOI). Using a probabilistic perspective, PMoveSTIR links animal movement, space use, and epidemiological dynamics, giving a view of FOI across the landscape that can be linked with environmental factors. %UDs are a useful bridge between movement and transmission processes, and we believe their widespread use and intuitive interpretation makes our approach straightforward to apply.
%Since 

Our framework is explicitly defined in epidemiological terms, emphasizing processes with temporal dynamics relevant for transmission, such as contact---direct and indirect---among individuals, parasite shedding and survival in the environment, and, importantly, correlation in space use. 
This framing sets our method apart from recent developments for inferring contact, which focus on direct encounters,  assuming hosts move independently \citep{Noonan2021,Das2023}. %This convenient assumption can be sufficient to infer the risk of transmission, but 
We have shown that this assumption could lead to significant underestimation of transmission risk, with consequences for inferred disease spread across the population. Our results provide clear expectations for what has been previously observed empirically but largely ignored in movement and disease models -- correlation in movement can reshape epidemiological landscapes, leading to hotspots of transmission whose magnitude and location are not necessarily predictable from models of joint space use.

The theory we develop here provides a clear, quantitative guide to assess when fine-scale, temporally synchronous movement data are necessary for capturing disease dynamics and when coarser scale, asynchronous data focused strictly on UD estimation and joint habitat use can be sufficient. 
%Our results clearly show that fine-scale movement details and in particular, beyond joint habitat use, matter greatly for quantifying and predicting invasion, spread, and persistence. 
In particular, we show that correlation in movement and synchronicity can be critical aspects of transmission for faster-paced parasites, i.e. parasites with short environmental persistence and transmission driven by short-term contacts \citep[cf.][]{Dougherty2018,Manlove2022}, such as canine distemper virus, rabies, \emph{Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae}, or SARS-COV-2 (SCV2). 
SCV2 is of particular public health interest and recent studies have shown that it can infect a wide-range of wildlife hosts, including white-tailed deer \citep{Palmer2021,Hale2022}. There is also evidence that white-tailed deer can transmit SCV2 between each other in controlled experiments and in the wild \citep{Martins2022,Hale2022}, suggesting SCV2 can successfully invade, spread, and persist in wildlife. 
%Contact is a fundamental component of disease dynamics and 

In contrast, correlation may only have marginal effects on transmission of parasites with longer persistence times like chronic wasting disease (CWD) and anthrax, for which joint space use would be largely sufficient for understanding local transmission risk. %Rather,  
%While temporal correlations in movement can play a sizable role in transmission for fast-paced pathogens, we found that ignoring these interactions 
Interestingly, transmission patterns of CWD in white-tailed deer only partially support this finding, as increased genetic relatedness (a proxy for social connectedness) increased the probability of infection beyond shared space use \citep{Grear2010}. Given the complex relationship between animal movements and time-lagged correlations (Fig. S1), there could be scenarios where correlations or direct contacts can disproportionately affect transmission risk even for pathogens with long environmental persistence. 

Correlations that are not accounted for by utilization distributions typically reflect social interactions, for example % There are multiple scenarios where strong social interactions lead to high spatio-temporal overlap: 
herding animals, parents with their offspring, or mates temporally moving together \citep{Yang2021} [other citations needed]. 
White-tailed deer female groups, for example, have high social affinity, especially during gestation and rut%, with groups becoming less cohesive or dissolving entirely during fawning 
\citep{Koen2017} [Better citations here...cite deer management book]. Thus, pairs of deer with equivalent habitat overlap have substantially higher contact rates when both individuals are within the same social group \citep{Schauber2007a,Kjaer2008,Schauber2015a,Grear2010}. This is likely the case in our empirical study; the pair with the greatest home range overlap and potential FOI were does, almost certainly from the same group. The potential FOI was over 10 times greater than for other pairs, despite similar degrees of habitat overlap. Importantly, 91\% of the total FOI (for a hypothetical directly transmitted pathogen like SCV2) would be missed if we only considered a joint utilization distribution. While the importance of social interactions for contact rates has been documented previously in white-tailed deer \citep{Grear2010,Schauber2015a}, PMoveSTIR allows us to directly quantify the contribution of these interactions to the FOI and move from qualitative conclusions to movement-informed quantitative models of disease invasion.

In practice, correlations influencing FOI may arise from fine-scale temporal patterns of resource use unrelated to social interactions. For instance, consider two individuals independently visiting a common resource at similar times \citep[e.g., a watering hole][]{VanderWaal2017}. If the resource is highly localized, the joint UD would not necessarily predict this as an area of high contact and transmission risk. % This interaction would instead be reflected in the correlation term of equation \ref{eq:stationary_cor}. 
Alternatively, temporally varying UDs (i.e. the top right corner in Fig. \ref{fig:square}) would likely capture spatial and temporal associations, reducing the relative importance of correlations that were not directly related to social interactions. However, non-parametrically estimating transient UDs (e.g., using AKDEs) at fine temporal scales with limited data points is not often feasible. Therefore, we expect the correlation term of PMoveSTIR will remain crucial to capture epidemiologically important spatial correlations in movement. 

% general limitations of correlation estimated from observations, to be made into a single paragraph or added to other
% link withlast paragraph currently, would free space to include something about epi factors.
%We found this spatial heterogeneity in transmission risk both in our simulations and empirical example, but we did not find any clear relationship between the probabilities of independent or joint use and local correlation. 
%In our simulations the environment is uniform, so the location of cells with meaningful correlations is basically random. Simulating movement for longer provides a more comprehensive view of the correlation surface, which is expected to be uniform and to relate that to the expected probabilities of encounter. There is, however, no evident relationship between the probabilities of use and the estimated local correlation. 
%This is not possible with the empirical data, the data length is what it is. More importantly, the environmental surface is not uniform as in the simulations. 
%Studying how environment predicts correlation is an important research direction for transmission, as we need to understand the expected correlation between individuals. 

By linking movement data and inferred contact with underlying environmental factors, a broad goal of PMoveSTIR is to facilitate creating an epidemiological risk landscape independent of geographical location \citep{Manlove2022}. This landscape may enable out-of-sample prediction of transmission risk, for example to forecast future disease dynamics in the study population, project population-wide disease spread as information on more individuals becomes available, or  quantify transmission risk for other populations in similar environments. Previous studies have created system-specific models that make this link, for example using probabilities of use informed by step selection functions with environmental covariates to simulate local disease dynamics \citep{Merkle2018}. Our model provides a generalizable theoretical foundation to perform similar analyses across different host-parasite systems, and it can be integrated with any UD estimation method \citep{Signer2017,Merkle2018,Michelot2020,Potts2023}. In addition to movement covariates, PMoveSTIR can also incorporate spatially and temporally heterogeneous epidemiological parameters, for example parasite survival rates that vary between habitats and seasons \citep{Daversa2017}, or spatially localized shedding \citep{Weinstein2018a}. 

Predicting epidemiological landscapes from host movements relies on the key assumption that environmental characteristics strongly influence movement and space use. While there is a growing number of methods that quantify the effect of environmental characteristics on movement and habitat use \citep[reviewed in][]{Hooten2017a}, there has been much less work exploring how (and if) environment affects and predicts correlation and synchrony among hosts [but see citations].  Although we describe space use probabilistically, the correlation term in PMoveSTIR still depends on observations, which can influence epidemiological inferences \citep{Wilber2022}. Depending on available data, there could be significant variation in the estimated FOI values and the location of transmission hotspots. Therefore, an essential next-step for building epidemiological landscapes will be predictive models of spatio-temporal correlation among individuals.  This is an open challenge, though recent progress in predicting the dynamics of group formation will likely be key \citep[e.g.][]{Brandell2021}.
Our analyses emphasize the importance of this next step by showing that correlations at a local (cell) scale can create a vastly more heterogeneous transmission landscape, where adjacent cells could have widely different risks of infection.  Moreover, correlations can lead to localized transmission hotspots that are not necessarily predictable from joint space use [e.g., Yang et al. in press], and may contribute to the growing empirical recognition that fine-scale, localized transmission hotspots are present in many empirical host-parasite systems \citep{Albery2021}.  Whether these localized transmission hotspots are predictable \emph{a priori} remains to be seen, but ignoring predictors of correlated movements can make the task orders of magnitude more difficult for some pathogens.

% Concluding remarks
% [Could drop] Our approach is flexible and should be readily applicable to many terrestrial host-parasite systems. Importantly, we expect that our spatially explicit, probabilistic framing will facilitate direct links between transmission risk and underlying environmental factors driving movement, contact, parasite development, and survival.  Ultimately, PMoveSTIR can help us build epidemiological landscapes informed by empirical movement data that can help predict and manage where diseases will invade, spread, and persist on real-world landscapes.


%Perfectly identical trajectories will be rare in empirical data, especially given measurement error in position estimation. 
%Our results therefore highlight how social processes can alter the predictions of contact relative to only the overlap of utilization distributions \citep{Yang2023}, and the importance of understanding and incorporating social structure into estimations of disease transmission \citep{Sah2018, Webber2023}.

% Correlations in animal movement have been studied mostly from a lens of social interactions, focusing on similarities in direction, speed, and position along entire trajectories, essentially determining whether animals influence each other's movement \citep{Schauber2015a,Scharf2018} [Add additional citations].

% 
% In both our simulated and empirical data, we found that correlation in space use can significantly increase local FOI compared to an assumption of independent movement, by orders of magnitude in some scenarios. 

 % high spatial correlation does not necessarily reflect social interaction.   and these could be independent of social interactions. We showed analytically and through simulations that high correlations can arise for animals that move independently if their home ranges overlap substantially. While correlated movement can generate local correlations, the two are not necessarily linked, and both processes may be driven by different environmental processes.
%This corresponds to the analytical case where space use is highly concentrated and similar between individuals. 

%While the associations could respond to social interactions in most cases, which would be independent of environment, there could also be spatial resources that generate predictable correlation patterns that may allow out of sample prediction, or at least provide expectations on the range of FOIs possible at a local scale, with and without correlation. 

% The magnitude and relative effect of correlation on FOI are modulated by epidemiological factors such as parasite transmission and survival in the environment, and epidemiological contact distance. We found that if decay rate is slow with respect to the frequency of visits of the hosts, correlation had little effect on the risk of transmission. In practical terms, this means that the FOI for parasites that can persist in the environment could be estimated based solely on the expected rate of encounter, which is proportional to the product of the UDs \citep{Noonan2021}. 

% The epidemiological threshold contact distance, which is reflected in our workflow as the side of the grid cells, also influenced the estimated FOI, although this effect was only clearly noticeable in two particular cases: when trajectories were perfectly identical, and when they were nearly identical. Larger grid cells should result in a reduction of the local FOI, as it would take longer to find a packet of pathogen across a larger area, but it also increases the probability of two individuals being in the same cell. This would explain the marked increase in FOI we observed for nearly identical trajectories, driven by increased contribution of correlation. Depending on the proximity of hosts in empirical applications, this definition of distance could therefore have a significant effect on FOI estimation, and special attention should be given to behaviors that drive transmission at small scales, like avoidance of feces and conspecifics \citep{Weinstein2018,Fox2013}.

% In our analyses we assumed environmental transmission stages of parasites can infect a new host immediately following deposition, and that they decay at a constant rate. Because of this, correlations at short lags had the greatest impact on the overall FOI. The PMoveSTIR framework nevertheless allows to use any type of survival function, for example step functions for parasites with sustained transmissibility, or functions with delayed transmissibility. Many helminths, for example, have an environmental development period during which they cannot infect a new host. Given the delay in transmission in these systems, we would expect correlation to play only a minor role, but this expectation should be tested with system-specific parameter estimates. Our results highlight the need for understanding the biology of parasites during free-living stages, and how their development and survival is affected by environmental conditions \citep{Thieltges2008}.   


   % With an increasing availability of movement data, it is important that we build strong links between to robustly understand  understanding these associations is an increasingly important task in a rapidly changing world, where infectious diseases represent significant concern for wildlife and human health, and we believe these tools will enable to have more comprehensive insight that could guide management strategies. 


 %This function is tractable and likely suitable for many parasites. The effect is nonetheless cumulative, if there are strong correlations over a range of lags close to 0 the force of infection will increase substantially. This would be the case for two individuals staying together in the same area, there would be an accumulation of viable parasite propagules in the environment that the hosts are exposed to. Conversely correlations at long and short lags have similar weight for parasites that can persist in the environment, and in many cases these correlations can offset the effects of one another, thereby reducing the overall effect of correlation. 

%

%In our simulations, the environment was uniform, and individual movement was only affected by the distance to the center of the home range. Natural environments, on the other hand, will be more heterogeneous, with resources that are localized in space as well as in time. While we did not quantify the interaction strength among our deer, the relatively small effects of correlation for some pairs could be consistent with virtually independent movements. These results further highlight the complex nature of the correlation term, which can capture the effect of social processes, but also random associations driven by the environment. 

%We found that greater spatial overlap increases the risk of transmission, in line with previous studies that have used home range overlap metrics to build transmission networks (REFS). However, we also found that spatial overlap alone can be an insufficient predictor of contact, and could lead to significant underestimation of transmission risk. 

 % What determines correlation?
%However, it is important to note that the additive terms in equation \ref{eq:stationary_cor} are not a perfect separation of spatial and social drivers of contact. If social factors are driving co-location they will also be present in determining $p_i(x)$ and $p_j(x)$. Thus, the marginal utilization distributions contain the effects of both spatial and social factors, but the correlation term is strictly related to social factors.  If the correlation is zero, then hosts are moving independently and $p_i(x)$ and $p_j(x)$ only reflect spatial factors.

%Our work is also linked with recent developments in theoretical understanding of (direct) encounter rates. Contact and, by extension, potential transmission events can be described analytically for individuals with stable home ranges using partial differential equations and their discrete space-time equivalent \citep{Das2023}. As the period of observation increases, the analytical description of first encounter probability converges onto the steady-state joint occupation probability, which corresponds to the conditional distribution of encounters in \citet{Noonan2021}. %Could you use this theory to predict the correlation? It could if there was a term of attraction to each other.
