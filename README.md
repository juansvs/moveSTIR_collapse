# moveSTIR_collapse

This repository contains code, simulations and documents relating to a generalization of the moveSTIR framework for linking spatial movement data with epidemiological transmission dynamics. The original framework was developed by Mark Wilber and published in Ecology Letters in 2022. The goal is to make the framework more general and to provide equations to analyze different types of data, or with different assumptions relating to specific case study scenarios.
